🔬 Multi-Spectral Gemstone Identification System - Project Summary
📋 Project Overview
We have developed a comprehensive, multi-spectral gemstone identification system that combines advanced spectral analysis with machine learning-based matching algorithms. The system is designed to distinguish between natural and synthetic gemstones using structural features extracted from Broadband (B), Laser (L), and UV (U) spectroscopy data.
🎯 Core Discovery & Innovation
Key Scientific Finding:
Natural vs Synthetic Discrimination: We discovered that natural sapphires exhibit "pre-mound structures" (plateaus and small mounds) before their main spectral mound, while synthetic sapphires show clean spectra without these preliminary features. This became a critical discriminating factor in our algorithm.
Enhanced Matching Algorithm:

Feature Compatibility Checking: Penalizes stones with extra features (e.g., if database stone has Peak but unknown doesn't)
Wavelength Precision Scoring: Small differences (≤0.1nm) get 100% score, graduated scoring for larger differences
Pure Spectral Analysis: No stone ID bias - matching based solely on spectral characteristics
