Project: Gemstone Spectral Analysis System
Purpose: Analyze gemstone spectra under different light sources (Halogen\broadband (H\B), Laser (L), UV (U)) to identify and characterize structural features for gemological identification.
System Architecture:
main.py (hub) → gemini_launcher.py → structural_analysis/
                                      ├── gemini_halogen_analyzer.py
                                      ├── gemini_laser_analyzer.py
                                      └── gemini_uv_analyzer.py
 though we have put some of the more recent programs into the active directory and are not in structural_analysis
Key Accomplishments:

Fixed Critical Normalization Issue:

Original: Tried normalizing at fixed wavelengths (B:650nm, L:450nm,U: 811nm) which failed when those wavelengths were 0 int. 
Solution: Normalize B: 650 nm to 50000, L:maximum intensity to 50000, U: 811 nm to 15000, then all spectra scaled across entire spectrum → 100
Result: Works for ANY spectrum regardless of absorption featuresStandardized Light Source Names:

'B' = Broadband/Halogen (650nm → 50,000 → 0-100)
'L' = Laser (Max → 50,000 → 0-100)
'U' = UV (811nm → 15,000 → 0-100)

Code Optimization:

need to Reduced each analyzer from line count.
Maintained all functionality while improving readability

Feature Marking System:

H\B and L spectra manually marked using 7 structural features: Baseline, Mound, Plateau, Peak, Trough, Shoulder, Valley, Diagnostic Region
Baseline marked in manual marking, with correction applied
Visual markers with undo capability. 
Need to clean up marking flow, magnify, select feature (ie mound, peak etc), mark curve. click on new feature when wishing to change. 
Saves to light-specific folders with timestamp


Visual Differentiation:

Halogen: Black spectrum line
Laser: Blue spectrum line
UV: Indigo spectrum with purple grid


Technical Stack:

Python with matplotlib, pandas, numpy, tkinter
CSV output to c:\users\david\gemini sp10 structural data\[light_source]\
Spectral data from .txt files in two-column format (wavelength, intensity)

accomplishments

main program working good
launcher working good
manual and auto detect working good
saving csv working good
upload csv to new db working good.

next step
reduce to line count on the big programs
decide are we running modular and are the subdirectories properly set up
use the gemlib_structural_ready.csv to bring gemstone information into the display output
bring in a graphic visualization of the matching results
create a screen display for the score summary of the gem top matches
