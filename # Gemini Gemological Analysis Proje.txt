# Gemini Gemological Analysis Project - Comprehensive Summary

## Project Overview

The Gemini project is an advanced gemological identification system that uses multi-spectral analysis to create unique "fingerprints" for gemstone materials. The system employs three distinct light sources to capture comprehensive spectral data, enabling precise identification and characterization of unknown gemstone specimens.

## Core Objectives

The system is designed to determine four critical gemological characteristics:

1. **Gemstone Identification** - Species and variety determination
2. **Origin Classification** - Natural vs. synthetic distinction  
3. **Treatment Detection** - Identification of enhancement processes
4. **Geographic Origin** - Country/region of origin determination

## Technical Approach

### Multi-Light Source Spectral Analysis

The system captures spectral data using three complementary light sources, each with specific normalization schemes and analysis methods:

**Halogen Light (B/H)**
- Broad-spectrum illumination for structural feature analysis
- **Manual Analysis**: Interactive point-and-click feature marking via GUI
- **8 Feature Types**: Baseline, Mound, Plateau, Peak, Trough, Shoulder, Valley, Diagnostic Region
- **Fixed Normalization**: 650nm reference → 50,000 intermediate → 0-100 final scale
- **Output**: 21-column CSV with detailed metadata (SNR, symmetry, baseline correction)

**405nm Laser (L)**  
- Coherent monochromatic source for precise wavelength interactions
- **Manual Analysis**: Similar GUI-based structural feature marking
- **Dynamic Normalization**: Maximum intensity → 50,000 intermediate → 0-100 final scale
- **Wavelength Tracking**: Records normalization wavelength for each analysis
- **Output**: 21-column CSV with comprehensive feature characterization

**Ultraviolet/Argon-Mercury (U)**
- Critical for fluorescence and diagnostic gemological properties
- **Automated Analysis**: Real-time peak detection with adjustable parameters
- **Fixed Normalization**: 811nm reference → 15,000 intermediate → 0-100 final scale
- **UV Ratio Analysis**: Preserves critical intensity relationships for identification
- **Output**: 8-column CSV optimized for database comparison

### Sophisticated Matching Algorithms

**UV Ratio Analysis (Fixed for 0-100 Scale)**
- Calculates intensity ratios relative to 811nm reference peak
- Preserves critical relationships despite normalization
- Diagnostic peak recognition (507nm for diamond, 302nm for corundum)
- Real peak filtering using statistical and standard peak methods
- Exponential similarity scoring: `100.0 * exp(-3.0 * ratio_difference)`

**Wavelength-Based Matching (Halogen/Laser)**
- Feature-type specific tolerance ranges (2-7nm depending on feature)
- Graduated penalty system for out-of-tolerance matches
- Missing/extra feature penalties
- Multi-feature type correlation analysis

**Normalization Validation System**
- Cross-validates normalization schemes between unknown and database entries
- Compatibility bonuses (+2%) and penalties (-5%)
- Intensity range validation (warns if data appears to be 0-1 vs 0-100 normalized)
- Reference wavelength verification for each light source

**Light Source Diagnostic Capabilities**

*Halogen (B) Analysis:*
- Color-related broad spectral features
- Critical diagnostic lines: 415nm (nitrogen in diamond), 594nm (annealing), 738nm (CVD silicon vacancy), 741nm (irradiation), 503nm, 575nm, 637nm
- Challenge: Similar responses from colorless/light-toned gems

*Laser (L) Analysis:*
- Highly diagnostic for specific gem types (especially diamond)
- Variable signal strength - some gems show no response or very noisy signals
- Precision measurements for sharp spectral features

*UV Analysis:*
- Most fingerprint-like spectral signatures
- Complex peak patterns requiring sophisticated automated detection
- Most challenging to map but highest identification potential

**Database Matching Strategy**
- Light source constraint: Unknown must match available database light sources
- Combined scoring across available light sources
- Tiebreaker rule: "Lowest high" score (gem with highest minimum individual score wins)
- Planned scale: 2000+ gems yielding 12,000+ total entries (3 light sources × 2 orientations × multiple scans)

**Quality Control and Methodology**
- Statistical quality control approach: 100 samples each for B and L spectra to establish consistent marking patterns
- UV spectra use automated detection (minimal consistency concerns)
- Asymmetric data sources: Auto-detected UV vs. manually marked B/L creates potential analysis bias
- Tolerance validation through repeated trial analysis demonstrates empirical basis for parameters
- Ongoing challenge: Manual marking consistency for weak diagnostic features

**Analysis Workflow Integration**
- Numerical analysis provides initial identification candidates
- Structural analysis disambiguates close numerical matches
- Example: If numerical analysis suggests "diamond" with natural/synthetic uncertainty, structural features (415nm nitrogen presence/absence, CVD indicators) provide definitive classification
- Multi-modal approach addresses limitations of individual techniques

**Current Development Status**
- Database recently rebuilt with corrected normalization and scaling
- Limited testing data due to recent normalization fixes
- Planned expansion: 600 owned gems → 2000+ total gem database
- Target: 12,000+ database entries across all combinations
- System has proven numerical analysis capabilities; structural integration in active development
